So what is C programming language?
-> The C programming language is a programming language created in 1960 in the Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. It is quite an old programming language which was used to program at a low level.

Why is C so famous?
-> C is primarly known for its ability to directly compile to machine code without requiring any intermediate, and it is known for giving complete control over your hardware. Due to this reasons. C often became a programming language used to program computers at very low level. It is 80 years old yet its still used till this date.

Should you learn C?
-> Absolutely.

About some terms and terminologies:
--- Headers
    These are the header files provided by a C library which includes prebuilt methods and syntax. Like stdio.h (Standard IO) includes the printf() method which is used to print some output to the cons    ole screen
--- C library
    A C library is a set of header files which contain already prebuilt lowlevel methods like printf, written in C itself. This is so that the programmer does not have to build everything on his own an    d can use functions and syntax provided already by a file.
--- C source Code
    C source code is the one which you write in a text editor.
--- Machine code
    The resultant of compilation of a C program
--- Linker
    The linker links a shared object or library with the machine code so that it can execute correctly.
--- C Compiler
    Examples: GCC, Clang. You need it to compile your C code to become understandable by the computer
