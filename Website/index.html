		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>So basically, I have gotten this website through a feature called GitHub pages, which allows you to post your open-source stuff on a website to make it more attractive, so I decided to do that too and I wanted to upload and talk about interests here.</p>
      </div>

		<h1>About</h1>
		<ul class="1"><li>This website is about to things related to software development, like Java coding or web development or Linux.</li></ul>
		<ul class="2"><li>This website is also the main website which will include all my projects like my LFS package manager.</li></ul>
		<ul class="3"><li>This website also has documentation which I use for my own reference and hope that it can be helpful for other people.</li></ul>
		<ul class="4"><li>This website is also my first actual website which can be accessed through the internet.</li></ul>

		<h1>About Developer</h1>
		<p>I am from India and I am a student. I also have experience in Java, advanced CSS, HTML and some Linux command knowledge. Also I advanced experience in Computer Architecture and Organisation</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<div class=arrow">
		</div>
		<h1>Plans</h1>
		<p>I plan to have more documentation on this website related to my interests, and I also look forward to more people visiting this website too. My developer plans are to get to understand how a computer actually works and performs tasks and I want to eventually make my own operating system which can work the same as any modern operating system.</p>

    	<div class="about">
		<h1>A short note about this website.</h1>
		<h2>Dedication</h2>
		<p>This entire website was made by me, myself means I had to think how to design every element myself. Altough I did end up working on this website really well until I realised I forgot some stuff which I had learned before in CSS. So yes, I did take help of the internet to recall a few concepts, which include animations, positioning, designing and etc.</p>
		<h2>Inspiration and motivation</h2>
		<p>I had also taken inspiration from some websites, of course not everyone is good in designing. It amazed me how certain developers can make something this good with just a styling language, very amazing indded</p>
		<h2>Who would want to come to this website</h2>
		<p>Certain people like developers can come to this website for inspiration, documentation and accessing information related to my package manager. So if you are a developer and want to learn some related to software, you can definetly come to this website and access information for free. Also there are no ads here yet (because i dont know how to add ads lol)</p>
